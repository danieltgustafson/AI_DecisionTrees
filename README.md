# AI_DecisionTrees
Project 4 for Intro to AI - Building Decision Trees

A more classical approach to a decision tree (compared to the Random Tree project).  Assignment was to build a class that would construct a decision tree from training data.  The decision tree uses Entropy and Information Gain to deterimine the best feature to split on and the best place within that feature to make the split.  

The split location optimization is done using simulating annealing (simulated internal method).

There are multiple classes in the decision_trees.py.
